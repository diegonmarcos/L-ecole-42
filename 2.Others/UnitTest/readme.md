It's great you're planning your C code tester with user stories and a roadmap! Here's a breakdown to help structure your project:

**I. User Stories**

* **US 1:** As a developer, I want the tester to identify all input strings, pointers, and lists so that I can track their initial values.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:** 
        *  The tester correctly identifies and stores all strings, pointers, and lists passed as arguments to the function/program being tested.
        *  The tester handles different data types (char*, int*, struct*, etc.) within pointers and lists.
* **US 2:** As a developer, I want the tester to identify all declared strings, pointers, and lists within the code so that I can monitor their modifications.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**
        * The tester correctly identifies and stores all strings, pointers, and lists declared within the function/program being tested.
        * The tester handles nested scopes and different variable lifetimes.
* **US 3:** As a developer, I want the tester to print the values of these variables after each line of code execution so that I can see how they change over time.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**
        * The tester inserts print statements after each line of the target code.
        * The tester efficiently prints the values of identified variables (strings, pointers, lists) in a readable format.
* **US 4:** As a developer, I want the tester to only print values when they change to avoid redundant output.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**
        * The tester compares current values with previous values before printing.
        * The tester uses efficient comparison methods (e.g., `strncmp` for strings, memory comparison for pointers and lists).

**II. Function Hierarchy**

1. **`main()`:**
   *  Handles command-line arguments (input C file).
   *  Calls the parser function.
   *  Initiates the testing process.

2. **`parse_code(char *filename)`:**
   * Reads the C source code file.
   * Uses a lexical analyzer (you might want to use tools like Flex) to identify tokens.
   * Extracts information about input variables, declared variables, and line-by-line code structure.
   * Stores this information in a suitable data structure (e.g., an abstract syntax tree).

3. **`instrument_code()`:**
   *  Inserts print statements after each line of code in the parsed code structure.
   *  Generates a modified C file with the added print statements.

4. **`execute_code()`:**
   *  Compiles the instrumented code.
   *  Runs the compiled executable.
   *  Captures the output.

5. **`analyze_output()`:**
   *  Processes the captured output.
   *  Compares values between consecutive lines.
   *  Prints only the changed values in a clear and organized format.

**III. Roadmap**

1. **Core Functionality (MVP):**
   * Focus on US 1, US 2, and a basic version of US 3.
   * Implement basic parsing, variable identification, and printing after each line.

2. **Optimized Printing:**
   * Implement US 4 to avoid redundant output.
   * Improve the output format for readability.

3. **Advanced Features:**
   *  Support for more complex data structures (e.g., trees, graphs).
   *  Integration with debugging tools (e.g., GDB).
   *  User interface (e.g., command-line options, configuration files).
   *  Error handling and reporting.

**IV. Backlogs**

* **Parsing complex C syntax:** Handle preprocessor directives, macros, and more intricate code structures.
* **Memory management:**  Ensure proper memory allocation and deallocation for dynamic data structures.
* **Performance optimization:** Improve efficiency, especially for large codebases.
* **Testing the tester:** Write comprehensive unit tests for your testing framework itself.

**Tools and Libraries:**

* **Flex and Bison:** For lexical analysis and parsing.
* **GCC:** For compiling the instrumented code.
* **Standard C libraries:** (`stdio.h`, `stdlib.h`, `string.h`)

**Important Considerations:**

* **Security:** Be mindful of potential vulnerabilities when executing arbitrary code.
* **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to provide informative messages to the user.
* **Modularity:** Design your code with modularity in mind for easier maintenance and future extensions.

This structured approach using user stories, a function hierarchy, and a roadmap will help you build a powerful and effective C code tester!
