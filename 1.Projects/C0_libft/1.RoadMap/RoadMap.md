Okay, I can help you design a roadmap for this C library project (libft). Here's a breakdown with user stories to guide development:

**I. Project Setup and Core Functionality**

* **User Story:** As a developer, I want to have a basic project structure with a Makefile so I can easily compile and manage the library.
    * Create the project directory.
    * Set up a basic Makefile with rules for compiling, cleaning, and creating the library archive.
    * Implement basic functions:
        * `ft_strlen`, `ft_strlcpy`, `ft_strlcat`, `ft_strchr`, `ft_strrchr`, `ft_strncmp` (string.h equivalents)
        * `ft_isalpha`, `ft_isdigit`, `ft_isalnum`, `ft_isascii`, `ft_toupper`, `ft_tolower` (ctype.h equivalents)
        * `ft_memset`, `ft_bzero`, `ft_memcpy`, `ft_memmove`, `ft_memchr`, `ft_memcmp` (string.h/stdlib.h equivalents) 

**II. Memory Management and Conversions**

* **User Story:** As a developer, I need functions to allocate and manage memory effectively, and to convert between data types.
    * Implement memory functions: `ft_calloc`, `ft_strdup`
    * Implement conversion functions: `ft_atoi`, `ft_itoa`

**III.  Input/Output and File Descriptors**

* **User Story:** As a developer, I want to be able to write to files using file descriptors.
    * Implement file descriptor functions: `ft_putchar_fd`, `ft_putstr_fd`, `ft_putendl_fd`, `ft_putnbr_fd`

**IV.  String Manipulation**

* **User Story:** As a developer, I need more advanced functions to manipulate strings efficiently.
    * Implement: `ft_strnstr`, `ft_substr`, `ft_strjoin`, `ft_strtrim`, `ft_split`, `ft_strmapi`, `ft_striteri`

**V. Bonus: Linked Lists**

* **User Story:** As a developer, I want to have a set of functions to work with linked lists.
    * Implement linked list functions: `ft_lstnew`, `ft_lstadd_front`, `ft_lstadd_back`, `ft_lstsize`, `ft_lstlast`, `ft_lstdelone`, `ft_lstclear`, `ft_lstiter`, `ft_lstmap`

**VI. Testing and Refinement**

* **User Story:** As a developer, I need to ensure all functions work correctly and handle edge cases.
    * Write comprehensive unit tests for all functions.
    * Test with various inputs, including edge cases and invalid input.
    * Refactor code for efficiency and readability.
    * Use a code style checker (e.g., `norminette`) to ensure code adheres to standards.

**VII. Documentation**

* **User Story:** As a developer using this library, I need clear documentation to understand how to use the functions.
    * Write clear and concise documentation for each function, including descriptions, parameters, return values, and example usage.
    * Consider using a documentation generator (e.g., Doxygen) to automate the process.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Version Control:** Use Git for version control throughout the project. Commit changes frequently with clear commit messages.
* **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling in your functions, for example, by returning appropriate values or setting error codes.
* **Memory Leaks:** Pay close attention to memory management to avoid memory leaks, especially in functions that allocate memory dynamically.
* **Code Style:** Follow consistent code style guidelines to ensure readability and maintainability.

This roadmap provides a structured approach to developing your `libft` project. You can adjust the order of implementation based on your preferences and priorities. Remember to focus on writing clean, efficient, and well-tested code.
