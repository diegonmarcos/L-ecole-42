	This roadmap outlines the steps involved in developing the `ft_get_next_line.c` function, as described in the provided project document.

### 1. Requirements
**References**
- [Subject](https://github.com/diegonmarcos/L-ecole-42/blob/main/1.Projects/C1_ft_printf/1.Roadmap/en.subject.pdf)
##### a) Mandatory
* The primary goal is to write a function named `get_next_line` that reads a line from a file descriptor. [cite: 24]
* The function should handle multiple calls, reading the file line by line until the end. [cite: 24]
* The function should return the read line, including the newline character (`\n`), or `NULL` if there is nothing more to read or an error occurs. [cite: 25, 26]
* The function should be able to read from both files and standard input. [cite: 27]
* A `BUFFER_SIZE` macro will define the buffer size for reading, and the function should adapt to different buffer sizes. [cite: 32, 33]
* Static variables are expected to manage data persistence between function calls. [cite: 4]
* Create the `get_next_line.c` and `get_next_line_utils.c` source files, along with the `get_next_line.h` header file. [cite: 24]
* Ensure compliance with the norm and handle memory allocation/deallocation properly. [cite: 6, 10]
* - Use Makefile with
	- Flags cc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -D BUFFER_SIZE=INPUT_VALUE
	- Rules $(NAME), all, clean, fclean and re. Extra rule for bonus to include extra libraries.
- File Structure Expected:
	- /main
	    - .../get_next_line.c
	    - .../get_next_line_utils.c
	    - .../get_next_line.h
	    - .../main.c

##### c) Edge Cases and Error Handling

##### d) Bonus

>_If you plan to complete the bonus part, think about the  
implementation of your extra features from the start. This way,  
you will avoid the pitfalls of a naive approach_
- Optimize the function to use only one static variable. [cite: 46]
- Extend the function to manage multiple file descriptors concurrently. [cite: 47]
- Create the bonus part files with the `_bonus.c` and `_bonus.h` suffixes. [cite: 50]  




### 2. Sources and Resources
#### a. Sources
- [Func Variaticas](https://trucosinformaticos.wordpress.com/2018/11/25/funciones-variadicas/)
#### b. Resources
#### c. Take Away
**General C Syntax:**
* **Pointers:** Understanding how to use pointers is crucial for all these projects.
* **Data Types:** Working with different data types (int, char, char*, etc.).
* **Conditional Statements (if, else):** Used for decision-making and branching.
* **Loops (while, for):** Used for repeated actions.
* **Functions:** Defining and calling functions to organize your code.
* **Structures:** For organizing data (more relevant in later circles).
* **Bitwise Operators:** Useful for working with flags and permissions in some cases.
### 3. Designing the Solution
#### a. Pseudocode PDL
* **Core Logic:** Implement a loop that reads a chunk of data from the file descriptor using the `read` system call. Search for a newline character within the buffer. [cite: 32, 33, 39]
* **Buffer Management:** Utilize a static variable to store the buffer and manage leftover data between calls. [cite: 4]
* **Line Assembly:** Concatenate the chunks of data read into a complete line. [cite: 40]
* **Error Handling:** Incorporate checks for errors during file reading. [cite: 26]
* **End-of-File:** Detect the end of the file and return `NULL` accordingly. [cite: 26]
#### b. Simplified Limited Implementation 
`(without: width, precision, flags, lacks error handling, other formatting options, edge cases and platform-specific details.) `

``` c
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

#define BUFFER_SIZE 42  // You can adjust this

char *get_next_line(int fd) {
  static char buffer[BUFFER_SIZE + 1];
  static int buffer_index = 0;
  static int bytes_read = 0;
  char *line = NULL;
  int line_index = 0;

  while (1) {
    // If we've reached the end of the buffer, read more data
    if (buffer_index >= bytes_read) {
      bytes_read = read(fd, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE);
      buffer_index = 0;

      // If we can't read any more data, we're done
      if (bytes_read <= 0) {
        return line;
      }
    }

    // If we find a newline character, we have a complete line
    if (buffer[buffer_index] == '\n') {
      line = realloc(line, line_index + 1); // +1 for null terminator
      line[line_index] = '\0';
      buffer_index++;
      return line;
    }

    // Otherwise, append the current character to the line
    line = realloc(line, line_index + 2); // +2 for the char and null terminator
    line[line_index] = buffer[buffer_index];
    line_index++;
    buffer_index++;
  }
}
```
###### Explanation

1. **Includes:** We include `unistd.h` for the `read` function and `stdlib.h` for `malloc` and `realloc`.
    
2. **BUFFER_SIZE:** This macro defines how many bytes we read from the file at a time.
    
3. **Static Variables:**
    
    - `buffer`: This holds the characters read from the file.
    - `buffer_index`: This keeps track of our current position in the buffer.
    - `bytes_read`: This stores the number of bytes read in the last `read` call.
4. **Initialization:**
    
    - `line`: This will store the line we're building. It's initialized to `NULL`.
    - `line_index`: This tracks our position in the `line`.
5. **Reading Loop:** The `while` loop continues until a line is found or the end of the file is reached.
    
6. **Reading from File:** If `buffer_index` reaches `bytes_read`, it means we've consumed all the data in the buffer, so we read more data from the file using `read`.
    
7. **Checking for Newline:** If we encounter a newline character (`\n`), we know we have a complete line. We allocate memory for the line (including the null terminator), copy the line from the buffer, and return it.
    
8. **Appending to Line:** If the current character isn't a newline, we reallocate memory for the line to accommodate the new character and add it to the line.

### 4. Unit Tester

* Write test cases to verify the function's behavior with different files, buffer sizes, and input scenarios. [cite: 17]

- Input Scenarios:
    - Empty file.
    - Corrupted file.
    - File with a single line.
    - File with multiple lines of varying lengths.
    - Lines with the maximum length that can be stored in the buffer.
    - Lines that are longer than the buffer size.
    - Reading from standard input.
- Inputs to be tested:
    - Text files with different content.
    - Standard input (simulated or using keyboard input).
- Outputs Expected:
    - Correctly read lines, including newline characters.
    - `NULL` when reaching the end of the file.
    - Proper handling of different buffer sizes.
    - No memory leaks.
- Files:
    - Files with a variety of characters, including special characters and Unicode characters.
    - Files with different line endings (e.g., `\n`, `\r\n`).
    - Corrupted file.
- Buffers sizes:
    - from 1 to 10,000,000
