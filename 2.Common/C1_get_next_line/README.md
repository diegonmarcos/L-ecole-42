### 42 Common Core Curriculum: Circle 1  - Algorithms & AI


**get_next_line:**

* **File I/O:**
    * `open(filename, flags)`: Opens a file with specific access modes (e.g., read, write).
    * `read(fd, buffer, size)`: Reads data from a file descriptor into a buffer.
    * `close(fd)`: Closes a file descriptor.
* **String Manipulation:**
    * `malloc(size)`: Dynamically allocates memory for the buffer.
    * `free(ptr)`: Frees memory previously allocated.
    * `ft_strchr(str, c)`: Finds the first occurrence of a character in a string (part of `libft`).
    * `ft_strjoin(s1, s2)`: Concatenates two strings (part of `libft`).
    * `ft_substr(s, start, len)`: Extracts a substring (part of `libft`).
* **Static Variables:**  Used to maintain state between function calls.


**General C Syntax:**

* **Pointers:** Understanding how to use pointers is crucial for all these projects.
* **Data Types:** Working with different data types (int, char, char*, etc.).
* **Conditional Statements (if, else):** Used for decision-making and branching.
* **Loops (while, for):** Used for repeated actions.
* **Functions:** Defining and calling functions to organize your code.
* **Structures:** For organizing data (more relevant in later circles).
* **Bitwise Operators:** Useful for working with flags and permissions in some cases.
