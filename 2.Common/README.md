## Projects by Topic

**Fundamental C Libraries & Tools**

*   **Libft:** _Your very own C library. You'll recreate essential functions like string manipulation, memory management, and linked lists. It's the foundation for many future projects._
*   **get_next_line (GNL):** Learn to read files efficiently, line by line. A key skill for working with large datasets or input streams.
*   **ft_printf:** Craft your own version of the standard printf function. This deep dive into formatting output will solidify your understanding of variadic functions and type specifiers.

**System Administration & Networking**

*   **Born2BeRoot (B2BR):** Get hands-on experience setting up a virtual machine from scratch, configuring services like SSH, and hardening it for security. It's a taste of real-world sysadmin tasks.
*   **NetPractice:** A series of exercises covering network protocols, sockets, and inter-process communication (IPC). You'll build simple clients and servers to understand how the internet works.

**Algorithms & Data Structures**

*   **push_swap:** Implement a sorting algorithm using only two stacks and a limited set of operations. It's a challenging puzzle that tests your problem-solving skills.

**Graphics & Visualization**

*   **fdf_or_so_long_or_fract-ol:** Choose one of these projects to explore basic 2D graphics.  
    *   **fdf:** Visualize wireframe models in 3D using isometric projection.
    *   **so_long:** Create a simple 2D game using a graphics library like MiniLibX.
    *   **fract-ol:** Generate beautiful fractal images (Mandelbrot, Julia sets, etc.).
*   **Cub3D_or_MiniRT:** Dive into 3D graphics!  
    *   **Cub3D:** Build a "Doom"-like first-person perspective engine with raycasting.
    *   **MiniRT:** Create a ray tracer to render realistic 3D scenes with lighting effects.

**Unix Processes & Communication**

*   **pipex_or_minitalk:** Choose a project focused on inter-process communication.
    *   **pipex:** Work with pipes to chain commands and redirect input/output.
    *   **minitalk:** Explore signal handling and bitwise operations for basic communication between processes.
*   **Minishell:** Craft your own simplified Unix shell. You'll handle commands, arguments, pipes, redirections, and environment variables.

**Concurrency & Parallelism**

*   **Philosophers:** Implement a classic synchronization problem with dining philosophers. It's a lesson in avoiding deadlocks and race conditions.
*   **Webserv_or_ft_IRC:** Choose a networking project to practice concurrent programming.
    *   **Webserv:** Build a basic web server that handles multiple client requests.
    *   **ft_IRC:** Create your own Internet Relay Chat (IRC) server for real-time messaging.

**Game Development & AI**

*   **Transcendence:** Design and build a multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG). It's a massive project that encompasses game logic, networking, and user interface design.

**Object-Oriented Programming (C++)**

*   **CPP 00-04 & CPP 05-09:** A series of modules introducing C++ concepts like classes, inheritance, templates, and the Standard Template Library (STL). It's a transition from procedural C to object-oriented programming.

**Additional Notes:**

*   **Reloaded:** Some projects have "Reloaded" versions, which are more challenging variations on the original theme.
*   **Inception:** A unique project involving virtual machines and system-level programming. It tests your understanding of memory management and processes.
