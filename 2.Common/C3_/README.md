### 42 Common Core Curriculum: Circle 3

**Projects:**

* **M.3:**
    * Minishell
    * Philosophers

**Topics (Advanced System & Network Programming):**

1.  **Advanced Shell Features:**
    *   Building a more complex shell with features like input/output redirection, pipes, and job control.
    *   Parsing and executing command lines with multiple commands and arguments.
    *   Handling environment variables and shell built-in commands.

2.  **Concurrency and Synchronization:**
    *   Understanding threads, processes, and their differences.
    *   Using mutexes, semaphores, and condition variables for synchronization.
    *   Solving classic synchronization problems like the dining philosophers problem.

3.  **Network Programming (Advanced):**
    *   Working with more complex network protocols (e.g., HTTP, FTP).
    *   Building client-server applications with multiple clients.
    *   Error handling and network security considerations.

4.  **Unix System Programming (Advanced):**
    *   Working with signals and signal handlers.
    *   Interacting with the kernel using system calls.
    *   Understanding memory management and virtual memory.

5.  **Projects and Challenges:**
    *   The Minishell project is the centerpiece of this circle, challenging you to create a functional shell similar to Bash or Zsh.
    *   The Philosophers project explores concurrency and synchronization concepts in a practical scenario. 
    *   You may also encounter other projects that delve deeper into network programming, system-level debugging, or performance optimization.
