### 42 Common Core Curriculum: Circle 1  - Algorithms & AI

## Curricullum
**Projects:**

* **M.1:**
    * get_next_line
    * Born2BeRoot
    * ft_printf

**Topics (Algorithms & AI):**

1.  **Introduction to Algorithms:**
    *   Basic concepts: time complexity (Big O notation), space complexity, algorithmic paradigms (e.g., divide and conquer, greedy, dynamic programming).
    *   Sorting algorithms (bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quick sort, etc.).
    *   Searching algorithms (linear search, binary search).

2.  **Data Structures:**
    *   Stacks, queues, linked lists, trees (binary trees, balanced trees), hash tables.
    *   Understanding how to choose the right data structure for different problems.

3.  **Graphs:**
    *   Graph representations (adjacency lists, adjacency matrices).
    *   Graph traversal algorithms (depth-first search, breadth-first search).
    *   Shortest path algorithms (Dijkstra's algorithm, Bellman-Ford algorithm).

4.  **Search Algorithms:**
    *   Advanced search techniques like A* search and its variants.
    *   Heuristic design for informed search.

5.  **Introduction to Machine Learning:**
    *   Basic concepts of supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning.
    *   Overview of common machine learning algorithms (linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, etc.).

**get_next_line:**

* **File I/O:**
    * `open(filename, flags)`: Opens a file with specific access modes (e.g., read, write).
    * `read(fd, buffer, size)`: Reads data from a file descriptor into a buffer.
    * `close(fd)`: Closes a file descriptor.
* **String Manipulation:**
    * `malloc(size)`: Dynamically allocates memory for the buffer.
    * `free(ptr)`: Frees memory previously allocated.
    * `ft_strchr(str, c)`: Finds the first occurrence of a character in a string (part of `libft`).
    * `ft_strjoin(s1, s2)`: Concatenates two strings (part of `libft`).
    * `ft_substr(s, start, len)`: Extracts a substring (part of `libft`).
* **Static Variables:**  Used to maintain state between function calls.

**Born2BeRoot:**

* **Shell Commands (Bash):**
    * `sudo`: Execute commands with elevated privileges.
    * `apt-get`: Package management for Debian-based systems.
    * `useradd`, `usermod`: Manage user accounts.
    * `ssh-keygen`: Generate SSH keys.
    * `ufw`: Uncomplicated Firewall (for basic firewall configuration).
* **Networking Commands:**
    * `ping`, `traceroute`: Network troubleshooting tools.
    * `netstat`: Display network connections and statistics.
    * `ifconfig`: Configure network interfaces.

**ft_printf:**

* **Variadic Functions:**
    * `va_start(ap, last)`: Initializes a `va_list` for accessing variable arguments.
    * `va_arg(ap, type)`: Retrieves the next argument of a specified type.
    * `va_end(ap)`: Cleans up the `va_list` when finished.
* **Format Specifiers:**
    * `%c`, `%s`, `%d`, `%i`, `%u`, `%x`, `%X`, `%p`, `%%`, etc.: Used to format different types of data (characters, strings, integers, unsigned integers, hexadecimal numbers, pointers, etc.).
* **String Manipulation:**
    * `ft_strlen`, `ft_strchr`, `ft_memcpy`, etc.: Functions from `libft` for working with strings.
* **Integer to String Conversion:**
    * Custom functions to convert integers to strings (e.g., `ft_itoa` or equivalent in `libft`).

**General C Syntax:**

* **Pointers:** Understanding how to use pointers is crucial for all these projects.
* **Data Types:** Working with different data types (int, char, char*, etc.).
* **Conditional Statements (if, else):** Used for decision-making and branching.
* **Loops (while, for):** Used for repeated actions.
* **Functions:** Defining and calling functions to organize your code.
* **Structures:** For organizing data (more relevant in later circles).
* **Bitwise Operators:** Useful for working with flags and permissions in some cases.
