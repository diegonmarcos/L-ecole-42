### 42 Common Core Curriculum: Circle 2

**Projects:**

* **M.2:**
    * push_swap
    * pipex (or minitalk)
    * fdf (or so_long or fract-ol)

**Topics (System & Network Programming):**

1.  **System Calls:**
    *   Understanding how programs interact with the operating system.
    *   Working with file descriptors, processes, and signals.
    *   Basic system calls (open, read, write, close, fork, execve, wait, etc.).

2.  **Processes and Inter-Process Communication (IPC):**
    *   Process creation and management.
    *   Understanding pipes, FIFOs, signals, and other IPC mechanisms.
    *   Implementing communication between processes.

3.  **File I/O:**
    *   Low-level file operations (open, read, write, close, seek, etc.).
    *   File permissions and access control.
    *   Working with different file types (regular files, directories, symbolic links).

4.  **Networking:**
    *   Introduction to network protocols (TCP, UDP).
    *   Socket programming for client-server communication.
    *   Basic network operations (connecting, sending/receiving data).

5.  **Shell Basics:**
    *   Understanding how shells work.
    *   Writing simple shell scripts.
    *   Working with environment variables and command-line arguments.

6.  **Projects and Challenges:**
    *   You'll likely work on projects that involve building small utilities, network tools, or even simplified versions of shell commands.
    *   These projects aim to deepen your understanding of system-level programming and how programs interact with the operating system and the network.
