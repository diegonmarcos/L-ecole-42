## Algorithms & AI: The Next Circle After Libft

After completing the Libft project and mastering the fundamentals of C programming, the 42 School Common Core curriculum typically progresses to the Algorithms & AI circle. This circle is designed to equip students with the essential knowledge and skills to tackle complex problem-solving and understand the foundations of artificial intelligence.

### Key Topics and Projects

   - **Searching Algorithms:** Mastering linear and binary search for efficient data retrieval.

2. **Data Structures**
   - **Stacks and Queues:** Understanding their LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) and FIFO (First-In, First-Out) principles and their applications.
   - **Linked Lists:**  Implementing singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists for dynamic data storage.
   - **Trees:**  Exploring binary trees, binary search trees, and balanced trees (e.g., AVL trees, red-black trees) for hierarchical data organization.
   - **Hash Tables:**  Implementing hash functions and collision resolution techniques for efficient data retrieval.

3. **Graphs**
   - **Graph Representations:**  Working with adjacency lists and adjacency matrices to model relationships between data elements.
   - **Graph Traversal:** Implementing depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS) to explore graph structures.
