- # ![](zimg/42.svg): The Code Odyssey 🚀
    Welcome to my 42 journey! This ain't your average school. We're diving deep into code, collaboration, and peer-driven learning.
  - ### About 42: Where the Wild Things Code 🌐
    42 is a global network of tuition-free coding schools.  Think of it as a coding bootcamp on steroids – intense, hands-on, and focused on real-world skills. There are no teachers, no lectures... just you, your peers, and a mountain of challenges.Learn more on the official [42 website](https://42.fr/en).
  - ### The Piscine: Sink or Swim 🏊‍♀️
     Admission starts with the "Piscine" (French for swimming pool). It's a month-long coding immersion experience designed to test your grit, problem-solving, and ability to learn independently.  It's tough, but those who make it through emerge as resilient coders.

## NORMINETTE
> At 42 School, it is expected that almost every project is written following the Norm, which is the coding standard of the school.

```
- No for, do...while, switch, case, goto, ternary operators, or variable-length arrays allowed;
- Each function must be a maximum of 25 lines, not counting the function's curly brackets;
- Each line must be at most 80 columns wide, with comments included;
- A function can take 4 named parameters maximum;
- No assigns and declarations in the same line (unless static);
- You can't declare more than 5 variables per function;
- ...
```

Let's code!

```C
#include "libft.h"
char	*ft_strdup(const char *s1)
{
	char	*str;
	size_t	len;

	len = ft_strlen(s1) + 1;
	str = (char *)malloc(sizeof(char) * len);
	if (str == NULL)
		return (NULL);
	ft_strlcpy(str, s1, len);
	return (str);
}
```

```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include "libft.h"   

int main() {
    // Test Cases
    char *original_str1 = "Hello, world!";
    char *original_str2 = ""; 
    char *original_str3 = NULL; 

    // Duplicate Strings
    char *dup_str1 = ft_strdup(original_str1);
    char *dup_str2 = ft_strdup(original_str2);
    char *dup_str3 = ft_strdup(original_str3);

    // Test and Print Results
    if (dup_str1 != NULL) {
        printf("Original: %s\n", original_str1);
        printf("Duplicate: %s\n", dup_str1);
        // Verify the contents - manually check if strings are equal
        if (ft_strcmp(dup_str1, original_str1) == 0) { // Assuming ft_strcmp is part of libft
            printf("Test 1 Passed: Duplicated strings match.\n");
        } else {
            printf("Test 1 Failed: Duplicated strings do not match.\n");
        }
        free(dup_str1); 
    } else {
        printf("Test 1 Failed: Memory allocation failed for dup_str1.\n");
    }

    // Similar tests for dup_str2 and dup_str3

    return 0;
```
