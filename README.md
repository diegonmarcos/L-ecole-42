# 42: The Code Odyssey 🚀

Welcome to my 42 journey! This ain't your average school. We're diving deep into code, collaboration, and peer-driven learning.

### About 42: Where the Wild Things Code 🌐

42 is a global network of tuition-free coding schools.  Think of it as a coding bootcamp on steroids – intense, hands-on, and focused on real-world skills. There are no teachers, no lectures... just you, your peers, and a mountain of challenges.

### The Piscine: Sink or Swim 🏊‍♀️

Admission starts with the "Piscine" (French for swimming pool). It's a month-long coding immersion experience designed to test your grit, problem-solving, and ability to learn independently.  It's tough, but those who make it through emerge as resilient coders.
